  Within our discoveries we shopped for a grey cable knit sweater, standing mowers, a fancy kite, and a high end gaming laptop. 
For the sweater, we saw that the options to colors and size showed up like regular buttons but actually functioned like radio 
buttons. This makes sense since you should only choose one of each option but it’s important to be able to initially see all 
the options when shopping for clothing. When you added the item to the cart, a side panel with the shopping cart would slide 
out. The regular page was greyed over and the cursor became an “x” button when moved away from the screen. Although the x didn’t 
seem fully necessary for online shoppers, it matched the aesthetic of the page while providing a bit more aid. The shopping 
cart screen preview is probably also beneficial to remind shoppers of other items they’ve added to the cart. 

  I think one store that stood out the most was the gaming laptop site. Because of the advanced nature of the item, the product 
needed more details on the page. What we found were many hidden ways to learn about specs and customize your laptop. For example, 
there were buttons to print the specs or save as an email. When you hit the buttons the PDF would pop up on a different tab. 
There’s also a button to share the specs on social media. Finally there were many checkboxes to filter the kinds of specs and 
radio buttons to customize. I was impressed that hiding the specs in a button allowed the page to look clean, even though the 
product requires so much information. Throughout the experience on this page, I was delighted by discovering all the features

	I believe the kite and lawn mower sites were less successful in creating a positive user experience. The lawn mower pages 
were very busy and full of information. When you hovered over the image a text overlay came up but it was a bit distracting. Some 
of the buttons also failed to work, such as how clicking reviews led to nothing. With the kite, one thing that was interesting was 
that you could select multiple assets to purchase together with the kite base, all on one page. Some elements that were universal 
were the radio buttons to select between options.
